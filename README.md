# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Trends Analysis

This project explores the global trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates using real-world data. It demonstrates data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Python data tools.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- ✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- ✅ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- ✅ Compare metrics across selected countries
- ✅ Visualize trends with charts and maps
- ✅ Summarize findings in a report

## 🗂️ Dataset

Source: [Our World in Data - COVID-19](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv)  
File: `owid-covid-data.csv`

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook 

## 📊 Key Features

- Line plots of total and daily cases/deaths
- Bar charts comparing countries
- Vaccination progress visualized
- Calculated death rates
- Cleaned and filtered data for accuracy

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Download the dataset from the link above and save it as `owid-covid-data.csv` in the same directory.
3. Open the notebook (`COVID19_Global_Trends_Analysis.ipynb`) in Jupyter.
4. Run the cells step-by-step.

## 🌍 Countries Analyzed

- Kenya 🇰🇪
- USA 🇺🇸
- India 🇮🇳

## 🧠 Insights & Findings

- Country X had the fastest vaccine rollout.
- Country Y had the highest death rate in early 2021.
- Trends in vaccination strongly correlate with reduced new cases.

## Key Insights
1. USA had the highest case counts but also the fastest vaccination rollout.
2. India saw sharp peaks in new cases mid-2021, followed by a decline.
3. Kenya’s death rate remained stable with lower absolute numbers.
4. Vaccination rates plateaued in some countries post-2022.
